You do not need to have a paypal account to use their service. You may pay with a credit card without creating an account. Here is a link to a step by step explanation on how to do that: \r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.etsy.com\/help\/article\/361\r\n\r\nIf you are having difficulties please contact me so I can assist you from my end.","policy_shipping":"Shipping: \r\nI use paypal or etsy labels for shipping, please take a minute and make sure your paypal address is correct. if you used the Etsy direct checkout the Etsy address provided will automatically be the ship to address. I normally ship USPS first class for both domestic & international.\r\nPlease be aware there was a large international increase from the USPS in January.\r\nIt is my policy that all orders to an apt. address will be shipped with signature required.\r\nIt is illegal for me to mark your international shipment as a gift, I will not.\r\n\r\nExpedited Shipping: \r\n\r\nDomestic priority mail (2-3 days) is available on all jewelry pieces for an additional 5.00 and domestic overnight is an additional 18.00.\r\nIf you would like priority mail to Canada with tracking the additional charge is 23.00.\r\n International express to Canada is an additional 35.00\r\nPlease contact me for a quote before purchasing if you need your international order sent priority mail or express mail.\r\n The times listed for delivery pertain to the mail service & there may still be some time needed to fabricate your piece. Please contact me if you have any questions about the arrival of your order.\r\n\r\nAlternate Shipping:\r\nBecause of recent changes to USPS I am now offering UPS Ground Domestically as an option and UPS Standard to Canada. UPS ground will be an additional 6.00 and UPS to Canada will be an additional 18.00-23.00 depending on your zone. Please be advised that when using UPS of FedEx to Canada they do charge additional duty fees for customs and those customs fees are the responsibility of the purchaser as I have no way to know what they will be or have the ability to pay them from here.\r\nIf you would prefer to ship with UPS please contact me to either revise the listing before purchase or send you an invoice for additional postage after purchase.\r\nAll UPS packages come with insurance and tracking.\r\n\r\n International:\r\nThe customs and tariff fees for international shipping are the responsibility of the buyer. I do my best to make sure things reach you safely and quickly but I have no control over customs or foreign postal services. Please note that some countries have different rules as to what can and cannot be imported, please be aware of your country&#39;s rules before purchase. I cannot at this time ship to Italy or Mexico.\r\n\r\nUpdate for UK deliveries:\r\nIt seems that the UK has changed their policy about incoming international packages and has started to impose a handling fee as well as a tariff. The handling fee seems to be somewhere around 8 pounds or 11 US dollars. The tariff varies according to the value of the item. Please be aware of these fees charged by your government if you are in the UK. I cannot mark the item gift on the customs form as it is illegal for me to do so.\r\n\r\nGoing Green : \r\nYou items will arrive artfully wrapped and in lovely boxes ready for gift giving.\r\nPackaging consists of recycled materials that are commercially recycled and clean. I use jewelry boxes made of recycled paper. 100% recycled cardboard box (made with 100% post-consumer fiber) is covered with FSC-certified recycled paper made from 30% post-consumer fiber. The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certifies that this paper is manufactured using ecologically responsible processes\u2014in this case, elemental chlorine-free (EFC) pulp or wind power. \r\nI try my best to be green when possible!\r\n\r\nA large percent of the silver used in my shop is commercially recycled silver. Recycled silver puts less of a strain on the planet as there is less mining. I am also bringing in more lab created stones as an alternative for those ecologically conscious about mining for gemstones. There are many colors and shapes of beautiful lab created stones, please contact me if you are looking for something you don&#39;t see in my shop.\r\n\r\n","policy_refunds":"Return policies:\r\nIf you are not happy with your purchase for any reason please let me know so I may fix the problem.\r\nI am more than happy to make size adjustments when I can, or make alterations when necessary.\r\nIf you would like to return the item, it must be sent back to me insured within 15 days of purchase in the unworn and new condition it was sent to you in (and in the same jewelry box shipped in to protect it from damage). Your refund will exclude shipping costs and a small restocking fee of 5% to cover non refunable fees incurred on the transaction.\r\n****  Custom sizes (rings made to order in your size) and custom work (items different from what is listed in my shop)  cannot be returned unless there is found to be a flaw in the workmanship. \r\nPlease understand that special ordered gemstones are not returnable. \r\nIf you are not sure of your ring size, please contact me for a free emailed ringsizer before purchase.\r\nI can in most cases resize the item for a 20.00 fee which covers my labor and supplies. If you need help with sizing I would be happy to email you a ring sizing gauge.\r\n","policy_additional":"The lead times for your items to be made to order are business days, Monday through Friday.
